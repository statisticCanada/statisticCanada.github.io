<td>Food Consumed Per Capita for Canadians (2009)</td>
<td>In the past two decades, Canadians have shifted towards a diet which includes more fruits and vegetables, cereal products, and nuts and beans. During this time, poultry consumption has increased, while beef and pork consumption has continued to decline. Oil and fat consumption increased through the 1990s to a peak in 1998, but has since been falling steadily. Sugar available for consumption has increased over the past two years from the record low set in 2007. On a per capita basis, the Canadian diet in 2009 included more fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, coffee and fish compared with 2008. In contrast, per capita availability has declined for consumption of processed fruit and vegetables, juices, dairy products and meat products. Estimates on food availability have been adjusted to account for losses in cooking, storage and waste that occur in homes, restaurants and institutions while preparing and processing food. On a per capita basis, the Canadian diet in 2009 included more fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, coffee and fish compared with 2008. Total fresh fruit intake, including citrus, reached a record 39.3 kg per person, up slightly from 2008. After reaching a record high in 2008, processed fruit in the diet fell by 2.4% in 2009. The total fresh vegetable intake, excluding potatoes, reached a record 40.7 kg per person in 2009, slightly higher than the five-year average of 38.6 kg per person.The amount of potatoes in the diet, regardless of how they were consumed, rose by 1.4% to 27.9 kg per person in 2009. This was the first increase since 2001. Per capita red meat available for consumption continued its decline in 2009, falling by 0.7% to 23.4 kg per person per year. Intake of poultry in the diet fell by 1.2% to 13.4 kg per person, similar to levels in 2006 and 2007. Canadians consumed 16.0 kg per person of dairy products, down 3.5% from 2008. Total cereal products available for consumption recovered in 2009, increasing 0.8% over 2008, following declines in the past four years. After six years of declines, the amount of sugar and syrup in the Canadian diet has risen for two years in a row, reaching 23.8 kg per person. Total oil and fat consumption continued to decline, falling to 17.9 kg per person in 2009, down by 3.6 kg from the peak of 21.4 kg per person in 1998. Coffee consumption increased 3.6% to 90.0 litres per person in 2009. The total daily intake of calories per person fell to 2358.2 calories, down by 155.0 since the peak recorded in 2001.</td>

<td>Trends and correlates of frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, 2007 to 2014 (Health Report)</td>
<td>Fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are a source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids. They also provide fibre, which is important for digestive health. Diets that include fruit and vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of some chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. High consumption of fruit and vegetables suggests better diet quality. In 2014, Canadians reported consuming fruit and vegetables an average of 4.7 times a day, a slight, but significant, decrease from 5.0 times a day in 2007. The decrease over time was no longer significant when fruit juice was excluded (dropping to an average of 4.1 times a day in both years). Canadians drank less juice in 2014 than in 2007, a decline that was apparent across all age, sex and household income quintiles, all regions, and all weight categories. In 2014, Canadians who reported consuming fruit and vegetables 5 or more times a day tended to be female, in younger age groups, in the highest household income quintile, and neither overweight nor obese.

More than a third of 4- to 9-year-olds did not have the recommended two daily servings of milk products. Over a quarter of Canadians aged 31 to 50 obtained more than 35% of their total calories from fat.

<td>Fruit and vegetable consumption, 2016 (Health Fact Sheets)</td>
<td>This is a Health fact sheet about fruit and vegetable consumption among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on Canadian Community Health Survey questions that measured the number of times respondents reported that they consumed fruit and vegetables, rather than the actual quantity consumed. Fruit and vegetable consumption provides an important source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, which may reduce the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. In 2016, 30.0% of Canadians aged 12 and older (roughly 8.6 million people) reported that they had consumed fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. Females were more likely than males to report consuming fruits and vegetables five or more times per day (36.9%, 22.9%). The proportion of males aged 12 and older who reported that they had consumed fruits and vegetables five or more times per day declined between 2015 and 2016 (24.8%, 22.9%), while the proportion for females remained stable. In 2016, fruit and vegetable consumption among females was lowest among those aged 12 to 17 (30.5%) and highest among those aged 35-49 (40.4%). Conversely, consumption of fruit and vegetable among males was higher among the 12 to 17 year olds (27.7%) compared to those aged 35 and older (Chart 1). Comparisons by province indicated that Quebec had the highest proportion of residents who reported eating fruits and vegetables at least five times daily (38.4%). Less than 1 in 5 (18.3%) respondents in Newfoundland and Labrador reported consuming fruits and vegetables 5 times a day. In 2016, fruit and vegetable consumption habits differed by the highest level of education attained by members of the household. When the highest level of completed education was below post-secondary, 24.1% of Canadians aged 12 and older ate fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. The proportion of people who consumed five or more fruits and vegetables per day was highest where post-secondary graduation was attained by a member of the household (31.7%). Fruit and vegetable consumption also varied by household income. The percentage of Canadians aged 12 and older who consumed fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was highest in households that fell within the highest income quintile (33.0%).  </td>

<td>This is a Health fact sheet about fruit and vegetable consumption among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on Canadian Community Health Survey questions that measured the number of times respondents reported that they consumed fruit and vegetables, rather than the actual quantity consumed. In 2015, 31.5% of Canadians aged 12 and older, roughly 9 million people, reported that they had consumed fruits and vegetables five or more times per day.Note Females were more likely than males to report consuming fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. In 2015, 38.0% of females and 24.8% of males reported such consumption. Fruit and vegetable consumption provides an important source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, which may reduce the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. In 2015, fruit and vegetable consumption was higher among males aged 12 to 17 (30.3%) compared to older males (around 24% for all other age groups), while females aged 12 to 17 (32.3%) reported a lower consumption of fruits and vegetables than older females (around 38% in the other age groups). The proportion of residents who reported eating fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was lower than the national average (31.5%) in: Newfoundland and Labrador (22.5%) Prince Edward Island (27.2%) Nova Scotia (25.3%) Ontario (28.7%) British Columbia (29.9%) The proportion of residents who reported eating fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was higher than the national average in Quebec (38.8%). The proportion of residents who reported eating fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was about the same as the national average in the other provinces. In 2015, fruit and vegetable consumption habits differed by the highest level of educationNote 5 attained by members of the household. When the highest level of education was below post-secondary, 24.3% of Canadians aged 12 and older ate fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. The proportion of people who consumed five or more fruits and vegetables per day was highest where post-secondary graduation was attained by a member of the household (33.4%). Fruit and vegetable consumption was also impacted by household income.Note 6 The percentage of Canadians aged 12 or older who consumed fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was lowest in households that fell within the lowest income quintile (27.4%). Consumption of fruits and vegetables among the other income quintiles did not differ from one another.</td>

In 2016, 19.0% of Canadians aged 12 and older (roughly 5.8 million people) reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. The proportion aged 12 and older who reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers remained stable between 2015 and 2016. Overall, males were more likely (23.8%) to report heavy drinking than females (14.2%) in 2016.The highest proportion of heavy drinking for both sexes was among those aged 18 to 34. In this age group, 34.4% of males and 23.4% of females were heavy drinkers. Despite the fact it is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under 18 in Canada 27.9% of Canadian youth aged 12 to 17 reported consuming an alcoholic beverage in the previous 12 months. Among those who did drink, 41.8% of them did so at least once a month. Overall 4.0% of youth were classified as heavy drinkers. The 2016 Canadian Community Health Survey included questions on alcohol use during the last week. According to Canada”s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines, 16.6% of Canadians are consuming alcohol at a level that puts their long term health at risk. Excessive alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. For males, heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. For females, heavy drinking refers to having consumed four or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. According to Canada”s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines, long term risks for alcohol consumption are liver disease and certain cancers. Males are classified at risk if they had more than 15 drinks in the week of reporting or at least one day with 4 or more drinks. Females are classified at risk if they had more than 10 drinks in the week of reporting or at least one day with 3 or more drinks.

In 2015, 19.2% of Canadians aged 12 and older, or roughly 5.8 million people, reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. Overall, males were more likely (24.1%) to report heavy drinking than females (14.5%) in 2015. The highest proportion of heavy drinking for both sexes was among those aged 18 to 34. In this age group, 36.2% of males and 24.9% of females were heavy drinkers. Given that it is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under 18 in Canada, the amount of heavy drinking among 12 to 17 year olds is expectedly low (4.1%). Despite the laws that prevent underage drinking, youth are still able to consume alcoholic beverages. In 2015, 27.0% of Canadian youth drank an alcoholic beverage in the previous 12 months and 40.8% of them did so at least once a month. The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was lower than the national average (19.2%) in British Columbia (17.3%). The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was higher than the national average in: Newfoundland and Labrador (25.6%) Quebec (20.2%) Saskatchewan (21.7%). The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was the same as the national average in the other provinces. The 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey also included questions on alcohol use during the last week. Of the 5.8 million heavy drinkers in 2015, 58.4% reported a level of alcohol consumption in the last week that put their long term health at risk. Among Canadians who were not heavy drinkers, 6.7% reported a level of consumption in the last week that poses long term risks. On average, Canadians who were classified as heavy drinkers had 9.8 drinks in the past week, compared to non-heavy drinkers who consumed 1.6 drinks.  Excessive alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. For males, heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. For females, heavy drinking refers to having consumed four or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year.

Starting in 2013, the limit for heavy drinking for females was reduced to four or more drinks.  In 2013, 18.9% (5.5 million) of Canadians aged 12 and over reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. Heavy drinking was reported among 24.5% of males and 13.4% of females in 2013. For males this rate was about the same as 2012 (24.3%), but a significant decrease from 26.8% in 2011. As a result of the change in definition of heavy drinking for females, 2013 estimates are not directly comparable to previous years. The increased proportion of female heavy drinkers from 10.7% in 2012 to 13.4% in 2013 is partly due to the new definition in 2013. Typically, a higher proportion of males report heavy drinking than females.  In 2013, this still holds true, even with the limit for females being lowered to four or more drinks.  Males were more likely to report heavy drinking than females for all ages, except between 12 and 17, where there was no significant difference between the sexes. The highest rates of heavy drinking for both sexes were among those aged 18 to 34. In the 18 to 19 age group, 38.3% of males and 28.2% of females reported heavy drinking.

<td>Heavy drinking, 2012 (Health Fact Sheets)</td>
<td>This is a Health fact sheet about heavy drinking among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. This level of alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. In 2012, 17.4% (5.0 million) of Canadians aged 12 and over reported heavy drinking, a decrease from 19.0% in 2011.  The rates of heavy drinking had remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2010 around 17% before increasing in 2011.  The decrease seen in 2012 is a return to the level seen in 2010. Heavy drinking was reported among 24.3% of males and 10.7% of females in 2012. For males this was a significant decrease from 26.8% in 2011 but a return to about the same level as in 2010.  For females there was no change from 2011. A higher proportion of males than females reported heavy drinking in every age group, except those 12 to 15 where there was no significant difference between the sexes. The highest rates of heavy drinking for both sexes were among those aged 18 to 34.  In the 18 to 19 age group, 36.7% of males and 27.0% of females reported heavy drinking, and in the 20 to 34 age group, the rates were 40.9% for males and 22.6% for females. The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was lower than the national average (17.4%) in: Ontario (15.4%) British Columbia (16.1%) The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was higher than the national average in: Newfoundland and Labrador (27.2%) Nova Scotia (22.3%) New Brunswick (19.9%) Quebec (18.9%) Northwest Territories (31.7%) Residents of the other provinces and territories reported rates that were about the same as the national average.</td>

The percentage of individuals who reported heavy drinking increased from 17.3% in 2010 to 19.0% in 2011.  Heavy drinking increased for both males (26.8%) and females (11.4%) in 2011 from 24.8% and 10.1% in 2010, respectively. A higher proportion of males than females reported heavy drinking in every age group, except in the group aged 12 to 15 where there was no significant difference between the sexes. Males aged 18 to 19 (39.4%) and 20 to 34 (44.0%) were the most likely to report heavy drinking, and females aged 18 to 19 (27.6%) and 20 to 34 (23.5%) were more likely to report heavy drinking than females in all other age groups.

From 2010 to 2011, there was no significant change in the percentage of 12 to 15 year-olds who had at least one alcoholic drink in the past year, though from 2001 to 2011 this percentage has declined from 30.2% to 22.5%. The percentage of 16 and 17 year olds who had at least one alcoholic drink in the past year declined from 68.2% in 2001 to 59.4% in 2011, though there was no significant change from 2010 to 2011.

Heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks per occasion, at least 12 times a year. This level of alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. In 2008, 24.1% of men and 9.6% of women reported heavy drinking. A higher proportion of men than women in every province and territory and in every age group, reported heavy drinking, with the exception of 12 to 15-year-olds among whom there was no significant difference between the sexes. Men aged 18 to 19 (44.4%) and 20 to 34 (39.1%) were the most likely to report heavy drinking. The heavy drinking rate was 15.5% in both Ontario and British Columbia, the only provinces where the rate was significantly below the national average of 16.7%. Rates in Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Alberta were about the same as the Canadian rate, and rates in all other provinces and territories were significantly higher. In rural areas 18.0% of the population engaged in heavy drinking, significantly above the rate of 16.5% in urban areas. The percentage who had had at least one alcoholic drink in the past year remained steady between 2001 and 2008 in the 16- to 24-year-old age range.

<td>Dietary habits of Aboriginal children (Health Reports)</td>
<td>Based on the results of Statistics Canada&#39;s 2006 Aboriginal Children&#39;s Survey, this article presents an overview of how often First Nations children living off reserve, Métis children and Inuit children aged 2 to 5 consume various types of food, including foods considered traditional or country among Aboriginal people. Considerable attention has been devoted to the health of Aboriginal children,1-3 but relatively little is known about their nutrition. The Health Canada publication, Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide – First Nations, Inuit and Métis (CFG),4 offers guidelines that include foods considered traditional or country among Aboriginal people, such as bannock and wild game. Based on the results of Statistics Canada’s 2006 Aboriginal Children’s Survey (ACS), this article presents an overview of the frequency with which First Nations children living off reserve, Métis children and Inuit children aged 2 to 5 consume various types of food .According to the 2006 ACS, the frequency with which First Nations children living off reserve and Métis children consumed items from major food groups tended to be similar. While lower percentages of Inuit children were reported to regularly consume items from these food groups, relatively high percentages consumed traditional or country foods. Around two-thirds of all Aboriginal children ate fast food and processed foods at least once a week, and just over half had salty snacks, sweets and desserts at least once a day. The frequency of consumption of various foods differed, depending on whether children lived in a CMA/CA.</td>

Physical characteristics such as crop areas and livestock inventory numbers as well as some distributional data are presented. The first bulletin of this series provides an overview of all farm types combined. The two remaining bulletins present sources and levels of off-farm income for farm operators and farm families for selected farm types. Depending on the variables, the discussion is presented by province or by revenue class. Comparisons of financial performance are also made for selected variables.

<td>Trends and correlates of frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, 2007 to 2014 (Health Report)</td>
<td>Fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are a source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids.They also provide fibre, which is important for digestive health. Diets that include fruit and vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of some chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. High consumption of fruit and vegetables suggests better diet quality.For people aged 12 or older, the 2007 Food Guide recommended 6 to 10 servings of fruit and vegetables a day.However, results of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), which used a 24-hour recall to collect nutrition data, showed that more than 50% of Canadians aged 12 or older consumed fewer than the recommended number of servings for their age and sex group.Note 8 According to the 2014 CCHS–Annual component, the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, which is a validated indicator of diet quality,was low, with fewer than 45% reporting at least 5 times a day. Unlike discrete time-points, linear trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake allow for an understanding of change over time. Based on annual data from the CCHS, the present analysis describes trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake among Canadians aged 12 or older from 2007 to 2014. The contribution of 100% pure fruit juice to these trends, and how fruit and vegetable intake differed by socio-demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) are also explored.</td>

<td>Dietary quality in Canada</td>
<td>Recommendations about what to eat, how much and what to avoid are designed to help prevent or control chronic conditions and diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, anemia, diabetes and obesity.1 In Canada, such recommendations come from a number of sources, notably, Canada’s Food Guide,2 Dietary Reference Intakes1 (a joint Canada-US initiative) published by the Institute of Medicine, and organizations targeting specific diseases, such as the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Diabetes Association.Beyond specific prescriptions and proscriptions, a multidimensional measure—an index—of overall diet quality is useful.  With such a measure, it is possible to evaluate the nutritional health of populations, trace trends in eating habits, compare different groups, and assess the value of qualitative indicators of eating habits.Over the years, several diet quality indexes have been developed.3-11 These indexes assess as many as four aspects of diet quality:  adequacy, moderation, variety and balance.  Adequacy is a measure of the sufficiency of intake of nutrients and foods;  moderation, whether certain nutrients or foods are consumed in excess; variety, the diversity of food choices; and balance, the equilibrium of food intake.Because nutrition recommendations in Canada and the United States are similar, the 2005 version of the American Healthy Eating Index can be adapted to the Canadian situation.4 This article presents an adaptation of that index and briefly outlines results for Canada based on data from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey–Nutrition.  The index is also used to evaluate the Canadian Community Health Survey module on vegetable and fruit consumption as an indicator of diet quality.</td>

<td>Components of American 2005 Healthy Eating Index, range of scores and scoring criteria</td>
<td>The Healthy Eating Index was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture to measure the quality of Americans’ diets.  The original 1995 version5 was based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid.24   The Index was revised in 20054 after publication of a new version of the Dietary Guidelines.  The Healthy Eating Index assesses two aspects of diet quality:  adequacy and moderation.  The maximum possible score is 100 points.  All components are measured continuously and are reported in relation to energy consumption (Table 1).  Intake between 0 and the maximum number of points possible for each component is prorated linearly.  For the sake of comparability in this analysis, amounts were converted into the equivalent of “servings” in the most recent (2007) recommendations in Canada’s Food Guide.2   Details on the how the components are defined and the foods included in some of the less evident components are available in a technical report</td>

<td>The American Index uses a proportional approach to energy intake—recommended intake of various types of food is expressed per 1,000 calories of total intake.  (A diet averaging 2,150 calories a day for an adult is assumed.)  To adapt this index for Canada, recommendations are expressed as number of servings, according to age and sex, as specified in the 2007 version of Canada’s Food Guide.2  As noted above, the 1992 classification of food groups was used (see Definitions) because it was the only one available when the analysis was conducted. The Canadian adaptation is comprised of eight adequacy components (total vegetables and fruit, whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables, total grain products, whole grains, milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives, and unsaturated fats) and three moderation components (measuring saturated fats, sodium, and “other food”) (Table 2).  For the eight adequacy components, points between 0 and the potential maximum score are assigned proportionally. </td>

Principal component analysis of the Canadian adaptation reveals that at least four factors exist, confirming that multiple factors underlie it as well. The vegetables and fruit components and the percentage of calories coming from “other foods” have the highest correlations with the total score.  Low correlations for dairy products and unsaturated fats indicate that the components measure another dimension of diet quality (Appendix Table D).</td>

<td>Cumulative percentage of daily energy intake from “other foods,” by population percentile, household population aged 2 or older, Canada excluding territories, 2004</td>
<td>The sodium component of the American Index is based on Institute of Medicine recommendations and is expressed per 1,000 calories consumed per day. The thresholds were established in relation to adequate intake (1,500 milligrams a day) and the tolerable upper intake level for an adult (2,300 milligrams a day).  Because the Canadian recommendations vary by age and sex, the Institute of Medicine recommendations by age and sex were used as the thresholds consumption in the Canadian adaptation.  Sodium consumption below adequate intake scores 10 points; consumption equal to the tolerable upper intake level  scores 8 points; consumption exceeding twice that level scores 0; and for consumption between the tolerable upper intake level  and twice the the tolerable upper intake level, scores between 0 and 8 are assigned proportionally.  As is the case for the American Index, points above the tolerable upper intake level  are assigned to prevent a flooring effect, since the usual sodium intake of the majority of the population (77% to 100%, depending on age and sex) exceeds the tolerable upper intake level.25The final moderation component of the index, worth  20  points, pertains to “discretionary calories,” a concept in the American Food Guide Pyramid, but not in Canada’s Food Guide.  The American Index assesses this component as calories derived from solid fats, alcohol and added sugar. For the Canadian adaptation, calories from “other foods” (as defined in the 1992 Canada Food Guide) represent the discretionary component. The American Index assigns 20 points for intake below 20% of calories, 0 points for intake greater than 50% of calories, and proportional points for intake between these levels, based on the 10th and 85th percentile of the distribution of daily energy intake from these sources. Application of the same reasoning to energy intake from “other foods” for the Canadian adaptation results in an interval from 5% to 40% of daily calories (Appendix Table A).</td>

Almost 17% of the population scored below 50; fewer than 1% scored more than 80. Children aged 2 to 8 had the highest index scores, averaging at least 65.  Scores tended to fall in early adolescence, stablizing around 55 in the 14-to-30 age range.  A gradual upturn through adulthood brought the average score to about 60 at age 71 or older.  At all ages, women’s index scores exceeded those of men. These patterns in average index scores were reflected in the percentages of various age-sex groups scoring below 50:  fewer than 3% of children aged 2 to 8, but more than 25% of 14- to 18-year-olds of both sexes and of men aged 19 to 30.

<td>Sugars are a type of carbohydrate found naturally in fruit, vegetables and milk. Sugars are also added to food to improve taste or for preservation, such as in the case of jams or jellies.

Added sugars are all sugars added to foods and beverages. Free sugars refer to monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices.The latest evidence on diet and health indicates that intakes of added sugars, in particular from sugar-sweetened beverages, are associated with the risk of excess body weight and obesity in children and adults.Note 3Note 4 The consumption of sugary beverages is also associated with the risk of dental caries and poor oral health in children.Note 5 In both adults and children, the World Health Organization recommends reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake.Note 2 In 2013, free sugars accounted for 62% of total sugars in Canadian prepackaged foods, although this ranged from 100% in soft drinks and fruit juices to 11% in nuts and seeds.Note 6Since national-level free sugars data are not currently available for Canadians, total sugars intakes were examined to understand sugars intakes in the population. National-level survey data on total sugars intakes for Canadians were previously collected in the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)—Nutrition. In 2004, Canadians aged 1 year and older consumed a daily average of 110 grams (26 teaspoons) of total sugars, approximately 20% of their total energy intake.Note 7 While over 30% of total sugars came from the vegetables and fruit category of Canada’s Food Guide, 35% of total sugars came from the “other” food category, which includes foods to limit, such as soft drinks and candy.More recent comprehensive national-level nutrition data were collected in the 2015 CCHS—Nutrition. In the absence of free sugars intake data, the objectives of these analyses were to describe the Canadian population’s dietary intakes of total sugars in 2015, and compare these results with estimates from 2004.

<td>Food Consumption in Canada: Part 1, 2002</td>
<td>Although cereals, mainly wheat, contain a lower percentage of protein than meats, they do represent an important source of protein. Not only did cereals contribute 23% of the total protein consumed by Canadians in 2001, but also the amount has been increasing, particularly since 1991. Since that year the protein provided by cereals has risen by 23%.The level of food energy consumed per Canadian, which remained relatively stable from the mid-seventies to the early 1990’s, jumped by 17% between 1991 and 2001. Rising consumption of oils followed by escalating wheat flour consumption were the major factors in the substantial increase in energy intake. Carbohydrates, the main source of energy, increased 15% between 1991 and 2001. Much of the growth can be attributed to consumers eating more pasta, specialty breads and cereal-based snacks. Total fat consumed from the food supply has climbed by 23% per person since 1991. The oils and fats category represents the biggest contributor to total fats, followed by the group of red meat, poultry and fish. A jump of 41% in the level of oils and fats is due in part to the increased use of oils throughout the 1990’s by households, fast food restaurants and other food service outlets in the preparation of salad dressings, fried foods and other commercial food products. On the other hand, the level of fat contributed by the red meat, poultry and fish group dropped to 21% in 2001 from 24% in 1991. This decrease was due principally to declining beef consumption. During the same period, consumers have turned to poultry, a naturally leaner meat, along with leaner cuts of beef and pork. Dairy products contributed to total fat 16% in 1991 compared to 14% in 2001. Lower milk consumption coupled with the shift to lower fat milk has resulted in fluid milk’s contribution to fat levels dropping dramatically. This decline has been more than offset by the large increase in fat due to increasing consumption of cheese and creams. Protein levels on the rise. The levels of protein per person provided by the Canadian food supply have been on the rise since the mid-1990’s. Overall, meat is the major source of protein with beef remaining the meat of choice for Canadians. Meat, including poultry, contributed 33% to the total in 2001, down somewhat from 1976 when it contributed 38%. Beef, as a protein source, declined sharply (39%) since 1976 while poultry has climbed 80%, partially offsetting the decline in beef. During the same period, the consumption of pork has fluctuated but remained fairly stable. Calcium levels increase. The levels of calcium continue to rise, standing in 2001 at its highest level since the late 1980’s. Milk and milk products, the largest contributor, accounts for over 70% of the calcium total. Consumers have turned increasingly to cheese and lower fat milk which has partially offset the trend to lower milk consumption. Growing consumption of fortified processed foods such as orange juice and breakfast cereal also contributed to the increase. Cholesterol levels rebounding. Total food cholesterol levels, after experiencing a steady decline since 1976 due to decreasing egg consumption, rose over the last few years. The increase in egg consumption, together with the growing popularity of cream has contributed to this growth but does not offset significantly the diminished contribution of red meat. Most other vitamins and minerals are also increasing. The levels of most vitamins and minerals available from the food supply have been increasing from 1991 to 2001. Canadians are eating more fruits and vegetables. Major factors contributing to the rise in consumption are the growing use of fresh-cut products, prepackaged salads and other processed products.</td>

<td>Food Consumption in Canada: Part 1, 2002</td>
<td>Although cereals, mainly wheat, contain a lower percentage of protein than meats, they do represent an important source of protein.

<td>Use of nutritional supplements, 2015</td>
<td>This is a health fact sheet about the use of nutritional supplements among Canadians aged one year and older. The results shown are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition, 2015 and 2004. Nutritional supplements are widely available to Canadians and many people supplement their diet with nutritional products such as vitamins, minerals, fibre supplements, antacids, and fish oils. In 2015, the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition asked Canadians aged one year and older about the type and amount of nutritional supplements they consumed in the past month. Canadians living in the west were more likely than those in the east to take a nutritional supplement in 2015. Compared with the national average, for both children and adults, the prevalence of using nutritional supplements was higher in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The highest rate of using supplements was in Alberta, both among children and teenagers at 54.1%, and among adults at 55.1%. Quebec and the Atlantic provinces had lower than national average rates of using nutritional supplements. The lowest rates were in Quebec, at 22.1% for children and teenagers, and 33.0 % for adults.</td>

<td>Bone health: Osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D</td>
<td>exceeds bone loss. The two processes balance out in adulthood, but with advancing age, bone mass starts to decrease. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized not only by a loss of bone mass, but also by increased bone fragility and risk of fracture. The condition primarily affects older people, particularly women, and is associated with 80% of fractures in people older than age 60. Those fractures can result in reduced quality of life, long hospital stays, institutionalization and higher mortality. The cost is high for the individuals involved and for the health care system. The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis usually entail special attention to the intake of two nutrients: calcium, which is essential for bone health, and vitamin D, which improves the absorption of calcium. Dairy products are the main dietary source of calcium, although it is also found in some fruits, vegetables and grain products. Very few foods provide concentrated Vitamin D. It is added to milk, which is the largest dietary source. The human body also creates vitamin D through sun exposure. Both calcium and vitamin D can be taken in the form of supplements. This article profiles the population aged 50 or older who reported having been diagnosed with osteoporosis. Variables associated with increased risk of diagnosis and differences between 2004 and 2009 are presented. Intake of calcium and vitamin D from food and from supplements is analyzed by the presence or absence of osteoporosis. In 2004, Canadians older than age 50 obtained an average of 771 mg of calcium a day from what they ate and drank.  Milk, cheese, bread, vegetables (except potatoes) and yogurt were the main dietary sources.  Based on the dietary reference intakes of the Institute of Medicine, about half of men aged 50 to 70 did not obtain adequate calcium from food alone;  for women aged 50 or older and for men aged 71 or older, the percentage with inadequate calcium intake from food was 80%. However, 28% of men and 48% of women aged 50 or older reported taking supplements containing calcium. Among those with osteoporosis, the percentages taking calcium supplements were higher—36% of men and 59% of women (data not shown). Total daily calcium intake from food and supplements combined averaged 969 mg for people aged 50 or older in 2004.  Depending on age group and sex, 45% to 70% had inadequate intake. The average total calcium intake of those who took supplements was 1,303 mg, 515 mg of which came from supplements.  Even so, 25% to 40% of them had inadequate total intake.  On the other hand, a substantial share of supplement users, particularly women, consumed more calcium than the tolerable upper intake level threshold of 2,000 mg. The amount of calcium obtained from food and beverages did not differ significantly between people who had and had not been diagnosed with osteoporosis. However, those with osteoporosis derived more calcium from supplements, which resulted in significantly higher total intake, compared with people who did not have osteoporosis. Milk, fish, margarine, eggs and beef are the main dietary sources of vitamin D.  In 2004, the food and beverages that Canadians aged 50 or older consumed gave them an average of 5.9 mg of vitamin D a day, well below the Institute of Medicine&#39;s EAR of 10 mg.  Based on diet alone, more than 80% of people in this age range were below the EAR. In 2004, 27% of men and 44% of women took vitamin D supplements.  For people with osteoporosis, the percentage using vitamin D supplements was 38% among men and 57% among women (data not shown). At age 50 or older, total daily vitamin D intake from diet and supplements combined averaged 10 mg.  However, 54% to 66% of people in this age range were below the EAR.  For supplement users alone, total vitamin D intake averaged 17.5 mg a day, 11.3 mg of which came from supplements; 12% to 17% of this population were below the EAR.  Fewer than 1% of people aged 50 or older had vitamin D intake above the tolerable upper intake level of 100 mg (data not shown). Men diagnosed with osteoporosis obtained less vitamin D from their diets than did men who did not have the condition;  when supplements were included, total vitamin D intake did not differ between men who did and did not have osteoporosis (Figure 3).  Among women, vitamin D intake from food and beverages was similar whether or not they had osteoporosis. However, when supplements were included, women with osteoporosis had significantly higher total vitamin D intake.</td>

<td>Socio-economic status and vitamin/mineral supplement use in Canada</td>
<td>This article examines factors related to Canadians&#39; use of vitamin/mineral supplements, with emphasis on associations with household income and education. The link between diet quality and socio-economic status (SES) may extend to the use of vitamin/mineral supplements.  This article examines factors related to Canadians&#39; use of such supplements, with emphasis on associations with household income and education. The prevalence of supplement use was significantly higher in females than in males in all age groups 14 or older.  Age, being female, high household income and education, and being food-secure were positively associated with supplement use.  Supplement use substantially increased the percentage of the population, particularly older adults, meeting the Adequate Intake level for calcium. The reported use of vitamin/mineral supplements varies by age, sex and SES.  The relatively low prevalence of use among Canadians of low SES is similar to findings from American studies.  These individuals, already at risk for inadequate intake from food, do not make up the difference with vitamin/mineral supplements. The use of supplements can increase daily intake of vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) beyond what is obtained from food alone, and thus, may confer health benefits, including chronic disease prevention</td>

<td>The effect of supplement use on vitamin C intake</td>
<td>This article provides an overview of vitamin C intake among Canadians and how levels are affected by supplement use. According to results from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey–Nutrition, Canadians get an average of 132 milligrams of vitamin C a day from food.  About one adult in five has inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C.  A third of Canadians take vitamin C supplements, which add 100 milligrams to total average daily intake.  Supplement use lowers the overall percentage of adults with inadequate intake by 5 percentage points to 17%.  Smokers, people who eat fruit and vegetables infrequently, and members of households with low income and low educational attainment tend to have relatively low vitamin C intake. Just under a third (31%) of Canadians took supplements containing vitamin C in 2004. In general, the groups that had higher average dietary intake of vitamin C were also the most likely to take supplements—36% of people who ate fruit and vegetables more than six times a day did so, as did 38% of those with the highest household incomes, 34% of those who belonged to a household with at least one postsecondary graduate, 35% who were physically active, and 32% of non-smokers. Quebec differed from the other provinces in that it had the highest dietary intake. More than 20% of Canadians do not get sufficient vitamin C from their diet. Roughly a third of the population takes vitamin C in the form of supplements. While supplements virtually eliminate inadequate intake among those who take them, the impact on the population as a whole is minimal.</td>

<td>Vitamin D status of Canadians 2007 to 2009</td>
<td>Most Canadians have vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women are more likely than men to have adequate vitamin D levels. In 2007-2009, almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. About 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels indicating vitamin D deficiency.  In 2007 to 2009, the average level of vitamin D for Canadians aged 6 to 79 was 67.7 nmol/L.  For both sexes, levels of vitamin D followed a U-shape by age group:  highest among children and seniors, and lowest at ages 20 to 39.  Levels tended to be higher among teenage girls and women than in teenage boys and men. Almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health (at least 37.5 nmol/L).  Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. As well, 35% of the population had levels above 75 nmol/L. The percentage with at least 75 nmol/L was highest among children aged 6 to 11 (49%) and seniors aged 60 to 79 (45%); it was lowest at ages 20 to 39 (30%). An estimated 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels below 27.5 nmol/L, indicating vitamin D deficiency.  The highest prevalence of deficiency—7%― was among men aged 20 to 39. Frequent milk consumption was related to vitamin D levels in people of all ages.  Those who consumed milk more than once a day averaged 75 nmol/L, compared with 63 nmol/L among those who consumed milk less than once a day.  White racial background was associated with higher levels of vitamin D.

<td>Vitamin D status of Canadians 2007 to 2009</td>
<td>Most Canadians have vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women are more likely than men to have adequate vitamin D levels. In 2007-2009, almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. About 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels indicating vitamin D deficiency.  In 2007 to 2009, the average level of vitamin D for Canadians aged 6 to 79 was 67.7 nmol/L.  For both sexes, levels of vitamin D followed a U-shape by age group:  highest among children and seniors, and lowest at ages 20 to 39.  Levels tended to be higher among teenage girls and women than in teenage boys and men. Almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health (at least 37.5 nmol/L).  Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. As well, 35% of the population had levels above 75 nmol/L. The percentage with at least 75 nmol/L was highest among children aged 6 to 11 (49%) and seniors aged 60 to 79 (45%); it was lowest at ages 20 to 39 (30%). An estimated 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels below 27.5 nmol/L, indicating vitamin D deficiency.  The highest prevalence of deficiency—7%― was among men aged 20 to 39. Frequent milk consumption was related to vitamin D levels in people of all ages.  Those who consumed milk more than once a day averaged 75 nmol/L, compared with 63 nmol/L among those who consumed milk less than once a day.  White racial background was associated with higher levels of vitamin D.  The average difference between people whose racial background was White and people of other backgrounds was approximately 19 nmol/L.

<td>Diet composition and obesity among Canadian adults</td>
<td>This study examines the association between obesity and the relative percentages of fats, carbohydrates, protein and fibre in the diets of Canadians. The data are from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition. The contribution of specific nutrients to obesity has not been definitively established. The objective of this study was to determine if an association exists between obesity and the relative percentages of fats, carbohydrates, protein and fibre in the diets of Canadians. When the effect of the control variables was taken into account, total kilocalories consumed increased the odds of obesity in men, and fibre intake decreased the odds.  Among women, only total kilocalories consumed was significantly associated with increased odds of obesity. Higher consumption of kilocalories increased the odds of obesity, but the relative amounts of fats, carbohydrates and protein were generally not significant.  The sole exception was an association between higher fibre intake and lower rates of obesity among men. The prevalence of obesity has been rising in Canada in recent decades. By 2004, 23.1% of adults were obese, nearly ten percentage points higher than in 1978 (13.8%). Dietary composition—the relative proportions of calories coming from fats, carbohydrates and protein, and intake of fibre— has been suspected of playing a role in obesity. However, few studies have examined the association between excess weight and the consumption of these nutrients, and the results are inconsistent. The unexpected and sometimes contradictory findings may be due to differences in sample size, time frames, and variations in how excess weight is measured. In addition, some of the studies could not account for key factors, including total energy intake and/or physical activity levels. Others were unable to adjust for under-reporting of calories consumed—a shortcoming of many nutrition studies. Results of the present study provide further evidence that it is not what you eat, but rather, how much—the total number of calories consumed—that significantly contributes to obesity.  The results also suggest that a diet rich in fibre is associated with a reduced risk of obesity.  This study highlights the importance of adjusting nutrition data for total energy intake and leisure-time physical activity, and especially, identifying and excluding respondents who substantially under-report the number of calories they consume.  Restricting the analysis to “plausible” respondents is an important methodological advance; without this correction, the association between calorie consumption and excess weight is lost or distorted. These results pertain to adults, and it is unclear if they apply to individuals younger than age 18.  Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity among young people, future research could usefully examine the association between diet composition and excess weight among children and adolescents.</td>

<td>Chicken continues to lead meat availability The availability of total poultry for consumption (including chicken, turkey, and stewing hens) was up 4.1% from 2017 to 25.9 kilograms of boneless weight per person in 2018. According to the annual release "Poultry and egg statistics" in The Daily on May 27, 2019, poultry production rose 4.0% in 2018—the ninth consecutive annual rise. Chicken led the increase, up 12.5% from a decade earlier to 20.8 kilograms available in 2018. The increase in poultry availability for consumption may be attributable to lower price increases for poultry compared with red meat in recent years, as well as for health reasons. Red meat available for consumption rose 3.9% from 2017 to 34.4 kilograms of boneless weight per person in 2018. The increase in availability in 2018 may be attributable to the lower price of beef and pork, according to the Consumer Price Index. However, beef availability remained 15.8% below 2008 levels, while pork availability was down 9.3% from 2008 to 15.8 kilograms of boneless weight per person.</td>

The decline was led by skim milk, down by almost half (-47.4%) from 2008 to 4.57 litres per person in 2018 due to lower production. Conversely, the availabilities of total cheese increased 13.4% from 2008 to 14.1 kilograms. Production and imports of cheddar cheese and variety cheeses were both up from a decade earlier, while processed cheese was down. The shift away from processed cheese towards other cheeses may be due to consumers choosing healthier food options. The availability of all cream, including table cream, sour cream, whipping cream and cereal cream, was up from 2008, largely due to increased production.</td>

<td>Canadian Community Health Survey - Annual Component (CCHS)</td>
<td>In 1991, the National Task Force on Health Information cited a number of issues and problems with the health information system. To respond to these issues, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), Statistics Canada and Health Canada joined forces to create a Health Information Roadmap. From this mandate, the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) was conceived. The CCHS is a cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status, health care utilization and health determinants for the Canadian population. The survey is offered in both official languages. It relies upon a large sample of respondents and is designed to provide reliable estimates at the health region level every 2 years.  The CCHS has the following objectives: - Support health surveillance programs by providing health data at the national, provincial and intra-provincial levels; - Provide a single data source for health research on small populations and rare characteristics; - Timely release of information easily accessible to a diverse community of users; - Create a flexible survey instrument that includes a rapid response option to address emerging issues related to the health of the population. The CCHS produces an annual microdata file and a file combining two years of data. The CCHS collection years can also be combined by users to examine populations or rare characteristics.The primary use of the CCHS data is for health surveillance and population health research. Federal and provincial departments of health and human resources, social service agencies, and other types of government agencies use the information collected from respondents to monitor, plan, implement and evaluate programs to improve the health of Canadians. Researchers from various fields use the information to conduct research to improve health. Non-profit health organizations and the media use the CCHS results to raise awareness about health, an issue of concern to all Canadians. The survey began collecting data in 2001 and was repeated every two years until 2005. Starting in 2007, data for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) were collected annually instead of every two years. While a sample of approximately 130,000 respondents were interviewed during the reference periods of 2001, 2003 and 2005, the sample size was changed to 65,000 respondents each year starting in 2007. In 2012, CCHS began work on a major redesign project that was completed and implemented for the 2015 cycle. The objectives of the redesign were to review the sampling methodology, adopt a new sample frame, modernize the content and review the target population. Consultations were held with federal, provincial and territorial share partners, health region authorities and academics. As a result of the redesign, the 2015 CCHS has a new collection strategy, is drawing the sample from two different frames and has undergone major content revisions. With all these factors taken together, caution should be taken when comparing data from previous cycles to data released for the 2015 cycle onwards.</td>

<td>Statistics Canada and Health Canada are jointly releasing a compendium of tables on nutrient intakes from food based on the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), Cycle 2.2 on nutrition. This survey collected information in 2004 from over 35,000 respondents of all ages residing in private households in all 10 provinces.  The CCHS 2.2 is the first national nutrition survey conducted by the Canadian government in over 30 years. The compendium provides summary data tables on the nutrient intakes from food by Canadians.  Data are provided for age-sex groups and various geographical areas: the provinces, the Atlantic Region, the Prairie Region, and Canada excluding the territories. This release represents Volume 1 of the series. Volume 1 contains 13 sets of tables, based on the core nutrients listed in the Nutrition Facts table found on food packaging.  The core nutrients include energy, six nutrients presented as a percentage of total energy intake and six nutrients as absolute amounts. In addition to the tables, a description of the methodology used to produce the tables is also provided.  Readers are encouraged to use the compendium in conjunction with Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, Nutrition (2004) — A Guide to Accessing and Interpreting the Data.</td>

<td>Overweight Canadian children and adolescents</td>
<td>Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents has risen, with the most substantial increases observed in economically developed countries.1 According to the results of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey: Nutrition (CCHS), a substantial share of Canadian youth are part of this trend. The 2004 CCHS was the first time in many years that interviewers directly measured the height and weight of a nationally representative sample of Canadians (see Data sources and analytical techniques). In the past, most health surveys relied on respondents to report their height and weight, a practice that tended to underestimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents and adults2, 3, 4, 5 (see Methodology makes a difference). The last time that the height and weight of a nationally representative sample of Canadian children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17) were directly measured was in 1978/79 as part of the Canada Health Survey. Results from that survey and the 2004 CCHS can be compared to get a better picture of the increase of overweight and obesity among young Canadians during the past quarter century. In 1978/79, 12% of 2- to 17-year-olds were overweight, and 3% were obese—a combined overweight/obesity rate of 15%. By 2004, the overweight rate for this age group was 18% (an estimated 1.1 million), and 8% were obese (about half a million)—a combined rate of 26%.</td>

<td>Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight</td>
<td>The percentage of Canadians who are overweight or obese has risen dramatically in recent years, mirroring a worldwide phenomenon.1, 2, 3, 4 The health consequences of excess weight are well known. It is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and gallbladder disease.5, 6, 7 As well, psychosocial problems, functional limitations and disabilities are associated with excess weight.5, 8 For more than a decade, information about the weight of Canadians has been based on self-reports, that is, survey respondents reported their own height and weight rather than being measured and weighed. However, such data are known to underestimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity.9, 10, 11, 12 The 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey: Nutrition (CCHS), which directly measured respondents’ height and weight, makes it possible to draw a more accurate picture (see Data sources and analytical techniques).</td>

<td>Nutrient Intakes from Food, Volume 1</td>
<td>Statistics Canada and Health Canada are jointly releasing a compendium of tables on nutrient intakes from food based on the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), Cycle 2.2 on nutrition. This survey collected information in 2004 from over 35,000 respondents of all ages residing in private households in all 10 provinces.  The CCHS 2.2 is the first national nutrition survey conducted by the Canadian government in over 30 years. The compendium provides summary data tables on the nutrient intakes from food by Canadians.  Data are provided for age-sex groups and various geographical areas: the provinces, the Atlantic Region, the Prairie Region, and Canada excluding the territories. This release represents Volume 1 of the series. Volume 1 contains 13 sets of tables, based on the core nutrients listed in the Nutrition Facts table found on food packaging.  The core nutrients include energy, six nutrients presented as a percentage of total energy intake and six nutrients as absolute amounts. In addition to the tables, a description of the methodology used to produce the tables is also provided.  Readers are encouraged to use the compendium in conjunction with Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, Nutrition (2004) — A Guide to Accessing and Interpreting the Data.</td>

The redesigned business survey questionnaires have a consistent look, structure and content. The integrated approach makes reporting easier for firms operating in different industries because they can provide similar information for each branch operation. This way they avoid having to respond to questionnaires that differ for each industry in terms of format, wording and even concepts. The combined results produce more coherent and accurate statistics on the economy.</td>

The dairy industry in Canada started in the 1500s when settlers brought dairy cattle over from Europe. It evolved in the late 1800s when Louis Pasteur invented pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill its bacteria. This innovation made milk consumption safer. The Canadian dairy industry has since grown into a $6 billion industry, as can be seen from 2015 farm cash receipts. It is the third-largest agricultural industry in Canada and the largest in Quebec.Note 1 Dairy milk is processed into fresh milk (of different fat content levels) and many different dairy products, including ice cream, yogurt and cheese.

<td>Economic Profile of the Mushroom Industry in Canada</td>
<td>Dominating the immobile portion of opisthokonts, Eumycetes grow inconspicuously on the ground in cities and forests. The common name “mushroom” is an umbrella term for thousands of varieties, each with its own unique properties (Campbell, 2007). Agri-food analysts have a strong tendency to cite edibility and marketing potential as the main qualities of this food product, giving only a few dozen species of mushrooms a place on grocery store and market shelves. But what does the mushroom industry in Canada look like and how is it evaluated? To answer this, this paper used data from the last few decades of Statistics Canada’s annual Mushroom Growers’ Survey and customs data from the Global Trade Atlas. This analysis assesses the mushroom production and marketing sector using qualitative values, production volumes, farm gate sales values, prices and export data. Using unpublished statistics, Note  the results will focus on the economic profile of two types of mushrooms that stand out because of their prevalence in the market basket and the techniques used to produce them, namely Agaricus mushrooms and other mushrooms, which will be referred to as specialty mushroomsNote  (shiitake, oyster, etc.).</td>

<td>Associations between household food insecurity and health outcomes in the Aboriginal population (excluding reserves)</td>
<td>Food insecurity exists when the availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or the ability to acquire such food in socially acceptable ways is limited or uncertain.1 It can range from the fear of not being able to provide or obtain food to hunger due to food shortages.  The deprivation of basic need represented by food insecurity is a possible precursor to suboptimal dietary intakes and compromised health and well-being.2,3 Food insecurity is thus an important public health issue, particularly for economically marginalized groups including Aboriginal peoples. In Canada, "Aboriginal peoples" are the descendants of the original inhabitants of North America, and include Status and non-Status Indians (First Nations), Métis and Inuit.8  Research shows that the health of these groups is less favourable than that of the non-Aboriginal population. Moreover, health inequalities persist when socio-economic factors, obesity and health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption are taken into account. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) provides information on health status, health care use and health determinants.  Although the survey excludes residents of Indian Reserves and some remote regions,10 the CCHS can be used to examine the health of the majority of Aboriginal people.  According to the 2001 Census, more than 70% of the Aboriginal population lived off a reserve, most of them (68%) in urban areas.11  The 2004 CCHS intentionally oversampled Aboriginal people aged 19 to 50 to allow for analysis of this subpopulation. The 2004 CCHS was the first cycle of the survey to measure household food security using the United States Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM).12,13  The HFSSM is an internationally validated 18-question measure of the food security status of  households in the previous 12 months.14  Household food insecurity (HFI) identified using the HFSSM is not the same as general income inadequacy; rather, it is a condition of deprivation due to resource constraint in one specific area of need.14 Based on responses to the HFSSM, one-third of Aboriginal households participating in the 2004 CCHS experienced multiple conditions characteristic of HFI; the figure for non-Aboriginal households was 9%.4 Aboriginal households had a higher prevalence of socio-demographic risk factors for HFI, and the relationship between HFI and these factors was stronger among Aboriginal respondents.4 The aim of the present exploratory study was to determine if HFI was a specific correlate of health in the Aboriginal population.  Data from the 2004 CCHS were  used to examine the relationship between HFI and self-reported health, well-being and health behaviours among adult Aboriginal respondents</td>

<td>In North America, hunger rarely reaches the drastic levels of deprivation that exist in poorer parts of the world. Consequently, to suit the North American context, researchers look beyond hunger to a broader concept, food insecurity.1 Food insecurity tends to be a continuum, progressing from uncertainty and anxiety about the householdís food supplies, to depletion of those supplies, altering the eating patterns of adults, and ultimately, when food supplies and resources are exhausted, hunger among children (see Food insecurity).2-4 A number of studies have examined the impact of food insecurity on nutrient intake and health.5-11 Compromised nutrition can affect an individualís physical and mental health and quality of life. At the community level, the consequences of poor nutrition are felt by the health care system. Poorly nourished people are usually less resistant to infections, and they tend to heal more slowly, have more diseases and longer hospital stays, and incur higher health care costs.12,13 Lack of food is not a problem generally associated with Canada. Canadians enjoy a high standard of living,14 and the prospect of hunger should be remote. Nonetheless, the number of food banks across the country continues to increase,15 and their substantial presence suggests that food insecurity not only exists, but persists.16-18 Until recently, estimating the prevalence of food insecurity in Canada has been constrained by a lack of data at the national level. Several studies have been conducted, but they were based on relatively small samples,10,20-22 such as food bank users, and therefore cannot be used to describe food insecurity across the country. In 1998/99, on behalf of Human Resources Development Canada, Statistics Canada asked questions about food insecurity on the National</td>

<td>Vitamin C status of Canadian adults: Findings from the 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey</td>
<td>Vitamin C, the common name for L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is not endogenously produced by humans.Note 1 Vitamin C has a number of biochemical and physiological functions, primarily as an enzyme cofactor (for example in the biosynthesis of collagen, carnitine, and catecholamines) and as an antioxidant. The richest sources of vitamin C are fruits, vegetables, and nutritional supplements. However, in 2013, fewer than half (41%) of Canadians reported consuming vegetables and fruit five or more times per day.Note 2 Insufficient vitamin C intake over several weeks causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue, fragile capillaries and poor wound healing.Note 3 Severe deficiency is rare in developed countries,Note 4 but may occur among people whose diet does not provide at least 10 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day.Note 1 Vitamin C intake has also been investigated in the prevention of certain health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurological disorders and certain types of cancer.Note 3Note 5Note 6Note 7 The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamin C varies by age and sex (non-pregnant, non-lactating) from a low of 13 mg a day for children aged 1 to 3 to a high of 75 mg a day for men aged 19 or older. Because smoking increases oxidative stress and metabolic turnover of vitamin C, the requirement for smokers is 35 mg a day higher than the EAR for non-smokers. The 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey collected biomarkers for vitamin C status. Based on those data, this study describes the vitamin C status (including deficiency) and determines its correlates in a nationally representative sample of Canadian adults. This is the first information that has been available about the vitamin C status of Canadians since the 1970/1972 Canada Nutrition Survey.Note 8</td>

The richest sources of vitamin C are fruits, vegetables, and nutritional supplements. However, in 2013, fewer than half (41%) of Canadians reported consuming vegetables and fruit five or more times per day.Note 2 Insufficient vitamin C intake over several weeks causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue, fragile capillaries and poor wound healing.Note 3 Severe deficiency is rare in developed countries,Note 4 but may occur among people whose diet does not provide at least 10 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day.Note 1 Vitamin C intake has also been investigated in the prevention of certain health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurological disorders and certain types of cancer.Note 3Note 5Note 6Note 7 The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamin C varies by age and sex (non-pregnant, non-lactating) from a low of 13 mg a day for children aged 1 to 3 to a high of 75 mg a day for men aged 19 or older. Because smoking increases oxidative stress and metabolic turnover of vitamin C, the requirement for smokers is 35 mg a day higher than the EAR for non-smokers. The 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey collected biomarkers for vitamin C status. Based on those data, this study describes the vitamin C status (including deficiency) and determines its correlates in a nationally representative sample of Canadian adults.

Members of the general population do not commonly need supplemental folic acid unless it is recommended by a health care professional for certain medical conditions. In fact, high levels of supplemental folic acid may mask and exacerbate vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the elderly, which could result in neurological damage.2-4 According to the Institute of Medicine&#39;s Dietary Reference Intakes, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for the population older than age 13 is 0.4 mg of folate a day.5 For women of childbearing age, an additional 0.4 mg per day from supplements or fortified foods is recommended.5 Because up to 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, and many women of childbearing age report irregular or no consumption of folic acid before pregnancy, in 1998, Canada approved folic acid fortification of white wheat and other selected grains, in addition to previously implemented supplementation recommendations.6 This analysis uses data from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) to investigate self-reported intake of folic acid-containing supplements (see The data).

<td>Effects of the Crop Reporting Cycle on Field Crop Statistics</td>
<td>The Field Crop Reporting Series produces national and provincial estimates on seeded and harvested areas, yields, production and on-farm stocks over the course of a crop cycle. The data provide an overview of field crops and insight into the farming industry in Canada. The timing of the survey collection period is crucial and ensures a timely and accurate picture of the crop situation, thereby meeting the industry need for these data. The March farm survey provides preliminary area estimates for the type of crop area that, at the time of collection, farmers intend to seed. The acreage is often reported at a time when there is still snow on the ground. However, the data on seeding intentions are used by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) to calculate its first grain estimates for the summer farm income forecast. The June farm survey provides the final estimates of the area that farmers actually seeded. The preliminary data obtained in the July farm survey provide AAFC with an early indication of production for the upcoming crop year. These estimates are used as a basis for subsequent surveys throughout the year (harvested area, yield and production). The model-based principal field crop estimates released in September provide yield and production data for select crops later in the season when crops are closer to maturity or in some cases when harvest has begun. Prior to 2016, traditional survey methodology was used to collect yield and production data for all crops at this time of year. In 2016, the September farm survey was replaced with model-based estimates derived using an innovative approach developed by Statistics Canada and AAFC. Lastly, the November farm survey collects final yield and production data once harvest is finished, except for a few crops for which harvest may continue later into the fall. In the field crop industry, several factors have a significant impact on farmers’ seeding decisions, affecting the preliminary intention (March) and final seeded area (June) data that producers provide to Statistics Canada. Factors such as price variability, weather events and socioeconomic influences have important impacts on seeded area estimates. With regard to production estimates, weather variances that occur between all the surveys can explain differences between estimates.</td>

<td>Bisphenol A concentrations in the Canadian population, 2007 to 2009</td>
<td>The 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is the first national survey to measure bisphenol A (BPA) in Canadians. BPA does not occur naturally in the environment. It is an industrial chemical used primarily in the production of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate is widely used in consumer products such as food containers and water bottles. Epoxy resins are used as protective linings for canned food and beverages, the inner coating on metal lids for glass jars and bottles, and dental sealants. People are mainly exposed to BPA through dietary intake, although drinking water, soil, dust, air, and some consumer products are also sources of BPA. BPA can migrate from food packaging, particularly when heated, as well as from repeat-use containers. Some studies on animals suggest that low levels of exposure to BPA very early in life can affect neural development and behaviour. However, there is some uncertainty in interpreting how these findings might be relevant to human health. One of the aims of the CHMS was to measure, for the first time, a number of environmental contaminants, including BPA, in a representative sample of the Canadian population. These first results of BPA concentrations will establish a baseline upon which future measures can be compared to study trends.</td>

<td>Metabolic syndrome in Canadians, 2009 to 2011</td>
<td>Results from the 2009 to 2011 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) indicate that 1 in 5 Canadian adults aged 18 to 79 had metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors that increase a person&#39;s risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.1 These risk factors include abdominal obesity (high waist circumference), elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high fasting blood glucose, and high blood pressure.1 Metabolic syndrome was found in 22% of Canadians aged 18 to 79 years (Chart 1). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases significantly with age such that only 1 in 10 Canadians aged 18 to 39 years were found to have metabolic syndrome compared to 4 in 10 Canadians aged 60 to 79 years. There were no significant differences found between males and females.</td>

<td>Healthy Behaviours, 2016</td>
<td>The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collects information on the various health behaviours of Canadians. This article combines four indicators of health behaviour into a single score, called the Healthy Behaviours Score (HBS), which counts the number of healthy behaviours an individual has (smoking, drinking, physical activity, and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption).  A score of 1 or 0 is given depending on whether the reported behaviour is healthy or not.  The HBS varies from 0 to 4 depending on the number of healthy behaviours reported. As an example, an individual who was a current smoker (0), physically active for at least 150 minutes in the week (1), not a heavy drinker (1), and eating fruits and vegetables 5 or more times per day (1) would have a score of 3 (0+1+1+1). n 2016, 51.5% of Canadians aged 18 and older (roughly 13.5 million people) had an HBS of 3 or 4, indicating a higher level of engagement with healthy behaviours. Overall, women were more likely than men to have a score of 3 or 4 (55.8% of women, compared to 46.9% of men).Note 2 The difference in the HBS between the sexes was attributable to the higher likelihood of men to be smokers or heavy drinkers and the higher likelihood of women to eat fruits and vegetables 5 or more times per day. These differences were somewhat offset by a higher rate of physical activity among men (Chart 1).</td>

<td>Potatoes: changing production, changing consumption</td>
<td>Whether they’re mashed, scalloped or french fried, potatoes have always been an important part of Canadians’ diets. In fact, they’re our favourite vegetable. In 2003, each Canadian consumed on average 113 kilograms of vegetables. About 30% of this consumption was potatoes, well ahead of the next most popular veggies: lettuce, carrots, onions and tomatoes. About half of Canada’s potato production goes to the fresh market and half to making processed foods such as fries and hash browns, potato chips and other potato products such as potato starch. Overall, consumption of fresh potatoes has been showing a gradual, but steady decline. Consumption of frozen potato products, mainly french fries, is also going down. On the other hand, Canadians are eating more other processed potato products, such as pressed potato chips and dehydrated products. The demand for potatoes may be declining because of various diets as well as consumer perceptions about its nutritional value. However, the fact is that they are a healthy food product.</td>

<td>Blue skies for blueberries</td>
<td>Got the “blues”? Certainly hope so. Blueberries are as Canadian as maple syrup, and blueberry production is a multimillion-dollar industry that is thriving in Canada. In terms of area under production, blueberries rank as the number one fruit crop in the country. Blueberries officially surpassed apples in top spot in 1996. In fact, the amount of land planted in apples has been declining, while the number of acres of blueberries has been steadily increasing since the 1980s. Blueberry sales have skyrocketed. In 2004, the farm-gate value of the crop reached nearly $130.9 million, compared with sales of $72 million in 1996. This represented an annual average increase of nearly 10%. The farm-gate value in 2004 was also a close second among fruits to the $137.1 million value of the nation’s apple crop. Canada has a long history of cultivating blueberries. For centuries, the “blues” were an important source of food and medicine for Aboriginal people, who would sun-dry the blueberries and grind them into a powder as way of preserving them. The sun-dried berries could then be mixed with corn and honey to make a kind of pudding, for example. Blueberry roots could be brewed to make a tea used to relax pregnant women. Nowadays, they are considered a low-calorie food that is a good source of fibre and that has a high level of “anthocyanins”, an antioxidant claimed to be beneficial in fighting aging, heart disease and cancer. Today, with new methods of preserving and processing blueberries, and their recent elevation to superfood status, the world’s appetite for blueberries is growing. Canada has an opportunity to play a major role in this growing industry. This article profiles the industry, examining its current economic status as well as blueberry cultivation and the fruit’s popularity worldwide</td>

<td>The expansion of large livestock farms between 1991 and 2001 </td>
<td>Over the last few years, the rapid expansion of large livestock1 operations has fuelled heated debates in many rural communities across Canada. Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. On one hand, promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution.  On the other hand, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life associated with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario. And still others are upset by prospects of added truck traffic, dust and noise resulting from feed and livestock transportation. New data show that the number of larger livestock operations is on the rise, and the number of animals on these larger operations is soaring. Using data from the 1991 and 2001 Censuses of Agriculture, this article examines how livestock farms have expanded within some of Canada’s more intensely settled rural areas. Populations of cattle and hogs are at a peak </td>

<td>Niche market or an expanding industry? Organic fruit and vegetable production in Canada</td>
<td>In the late 1990s, media and farming journals were reporting that organic production was the wave of the future. Organic production had the reported positives of being environmentally friendly and producing a higher gross return, and was considered to be of higher quality by the consumer. It was common to hear anecdotal reports that the organic industry was growing by 20% a year and would soon rival conventional food production methods for market dominance. Through organic production methods, the agricultural producer has tried to address consumer demand for healthy, pesticide-free and ecologically responsible food production. In exchange for this specialized method of food production, the consumer has demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for organic food in the supermarkets, farmer’s markets, and so on. In 2000, Statistics Canada began tracking the significance of the organic food production industry by exploring organic fruit and vegetable production. This paper will be a descriptive analysis of the organic data collected between 2000 and 2003. The analysis will compare the participation rates, production locations, rates of expansion and revenues generated by organic fruit and vegetable producers to those of conventional producers.</td>
